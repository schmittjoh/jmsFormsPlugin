This plugin provides several enhancements to symfony's form framework.
It was designed with the Doctrine ORM in mind, so most of the good stuff
is not available for Propel, (yet? contributions welcome :)).


Enhancements
============
* Better support for manipulating forms via Javascript on the client-side
* Better support for complex forms (embedding forms with several levels)
* Better support for handling collections (one-to-many relations)
* Several miscellaneous enhancements


What's next?
